The bathroom was clean and well maintained and the trash wasn't overflowing in the canisters around the store.  The pastries looked fresh, but I didn't partake.  The noise level was also at a nice working level - not too loud, music just barely audible.\\\\n\\\\nI do wish there was more seating.  It is nice that this location has a counter at the end of the bar for sole workers, but it doesn't replace more tables.  I'm sure this isn't as much of a problem in the summer when there's the space outside.\\\\n\\\\nThere was a treat receipt promo going on, but the barista didn't tell me about it, which I found odd.  Usually when they have promos like that going on, they ask everyone if they want their receipt to come back later in the day to claim whatever the offer is.  Today it was one of their new pastries for $1, I know in the summer they do $2 grande iced drinks with that morning's receipt.\\\\n\\\\nOverall, nice working or socializing environment.

(Considering all the open areas here, maybe summer is not the best place to check it out) Since I turned 20, I only went to malls for art galleries and annual/semi-annual sales...or if I had no other choice. Other times, I liked to immerse myself in a quiet, naturistic place where birds sing and wind rustles through the leaves. \\n\\nSince I've gotten back into school &amp; work mode, I haven't had a lot of time to spare for my family and mommy, it being her day off on Monday, asked if we could have a picnic together. We both got up early, got ourselves tickets to the garden (it's free) and had a nice breakfast in one of the shaded tables next to the gallery. The weather was perfect that day, 75 degrees, warm enough for t-shirts and sunblock. We had a nice chat before heading to the artistically landscaped gardens. \\n\\nRecently, the preserve unraveled their new solar house - desertsol - open for people who are interested in sustainable living and looking for inspiration on how to build themselves an environmentally friendly house. I believe it's only available for viewing upon a general admission ticket purchase but from what I've heard, it's definitely worth it. New harvests have begun to bud, revealing tomato leaves and all sorts of beautiful flowers.\\n\\nIt's a great get away from hype that Vegas is and offers a relaxing atmosphere for nature lovers.

Didn't address any concerns of mine, or ask if anything has changed since last time. He continued to 'encourage' me to buy a book, that he happened to write, and that was it.

There were plenty of 20-somethings, a ton of middle-aged folks and even families with babies mixed in.\\n\\nWhile the atmosphere was slightly above average, the food was excellent. I started with a bowl of mushroom-filled miso soup ($6), which was vegan and chock full of shrooms, scallions and tofu. I loved it!\\n\\nI paired my meal with a Cucumber Refresher ($4), a cucumber-infused honey lemonade. It was sweet, refreshing and didn't make me feel guilty about drinking it.\\n\\nFor my entree, I ordered a ricotta ravioli ($13), which was covered in a pesto sauce, more mushrooms and red peppers.

The service was absolute poppycock and the food was rubbish.\\n\\nMe and my 5 DCs had a late dinner here after a long day at Osheaga mainly because most of the other kitchens along this strip were closed. We might of been able to avoid this disaster of a place if only we had consulted with Yelp first.\\n\\nWe all ordered vermicelli bowls since we were starving and it's quick to make...or so we though. We ended up waiting over 30 minutes for the dishes to arrive and they were brought 5-10 minutes apart! No, they were not busy - there was only another table of 4 that had ordered. Given that it takes all of 60 seconds to cook vermicelli and another 2-3 minutes to grill the meat...FAIL.\\n\\nThe EPIC FAIL, however, began when I enquired about my forgotten order. The waiter gave me a dirty look of acknowledgement and trotted off to the kitchen. My vermicelli bowl was soon plopped down in front of me with 2 small burnt pieces of beef and partially cooked vermicelli that was still hard! I complained about the laughably small portion (compared to my DC's orders) and was told that because I got a spring roll, I got less beef than everyone else. WTF? JTFC! Spring rolls comes with each vermicelli by default! I then showed him the raw vermicelli, and he gave me yet another exasperated look, took my bowl away and left without saying a word. \\n\\nI was so PO'ed at that point, I chased him down to cancel the order - no way was I gonna wait another 30 minutes nor risk them tampering with my food. He turned to me, tossed my bowl onto the kitchen table and left again without saying a word. No apology, no nothing. They were equally rude and indifferent to my DC who also had uncooked vermicelli and to my DC that they overcharged with items he never ordered.\\n\\nAnd to top it off, their vermicelli bowls really sucked (even accounting for the cooked portions of it): bland flavours, few veggies, no garnishes and a miserly spring roll filled with more vermicelli!\\n\\nI don't think I've ever experienced such rude and incompetent service, let alone completely cancel an order because of how quickly things went downhill. I couldn't even recommend this place to my worst enemy because it would give this place unwarranted business. Yelpers, you've been warned.</td>\n",
