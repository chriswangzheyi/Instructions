    ['1872fairy tales of hans christian andersena cheerful temperby hans christian andersenfrom my father i received the best inheritance , namely a " goodtemper . " ',
     ' " and who was my father ? " ',
     ' that has nothing to do with the goodtemper ; but i will say he was lively , good-looking round , and fat ; he was both in appearance and character a complete contradiction tohis profession . " ',
     ' " and pray what was his profession and his standingin respectable society ? " ',
     ' well , perhaps , if in the beginning of abook these were written and printed , many , when they read it , wouldlay the book down and say , " it seems to me a very miserable title , idon\'t like things of this sort . " ',
     ' and yet my father was not askin-dresser nor an executioner ; on the contrary , his employmentplaced him at the head of the grandest people of the town , and itwas his place by right . " ',
     'he had to precede the bishop , and even theprinces of the blood ; he always went first , - he was a hearse driver ! there , now , the truth is out . " ',
     'and i will own , that when people sawmy father perched up in front of the omnibus of death , dressed inhis long , wide , black cloak , and his black-edged , three-cornered haton his head , and then glanced at his round , jocund face , round asthe sun , they could not think much of sorrow or the grave . " ',
     'that facesaid , " it is nothing , it will all end better than people think . " ',
     ' soi have inherited from him , not only my good temper , but a habit ofgoing often to the churchyard , which is good , when done in a properhumor ; and then also i take in the intelligencer , just as he used todo . i am not very young , i have neither wife nor children , nor alibrary , but , as i said , i read the intelligencer , which is enough forme ; it is to me a delightful paper , and so it was to my father . " ',
     'itis of great use , for it contains all that a man requires to know ; the names of the preachers at the church , and the new books whichare published ; where houses , servants , clothes , and provisions maybe obtained . " ',
     'and then what a number of subscriptions to charities , andwhat innocent verses ! " ',
     'persons seeking interviews and engagements , all so plainly and naturally stated . " ',
     'certainly , a man who takes in theintelligencer may live merrily and be buried contentedly , and by theend of his life will have such a capital stock of paper that he canlie on a soft bed of it , unless he prefers wood shavings for hisresting-place . " ',
     'the newspaper and the churchyard were always excitingobjects to me . " ',
     'my walks to the latter were like bathing-places to mygood humor . " ',
     'every one can read the newspaper for himself , but comewith me to the churchyard while the sun shines and the trees aregreen , and let us wander among the graves . " ',
     'each of them is like aclosed book , with the back uppermost , on which we can read the titleof what the book contains , but nothing more . " ',
     'i had a great deal ofinformation from my father , and i have noticed a great deal myself . i keep it in my diary , in which i write for my own use and pleasurea history of all who lie here , and a few more beside . now we are in the churchyard . " ',
     'here , behind the white ironrailings , once a rose-tree grew ; it is gone now , but a little bit ofevergreen , from a neighboring grave , stretches out its green tendrils , and makes some appearance ; there rests a very unhappy man , and yetwhile he lived he might be said to occupy a very good position . " ',
     'he hadenough to live upon , and something to spare ; but owing to hisrefined tastes the least thing in the world annoyed him . " ',
     'if he went toa theatre of an evening , instead of enjoying himself he would be quiteannoyed if the machinist had put too strong a light into one side ofthe moon , or if the representations of the sky hung over the sceneswhen they ought to have hung behind them ; or if a palm-tree wasintroduced into a scene representing the zoological gardens of berlin , or a cactus in a view of tyrol , or a beech-tree in the north ofnorway . " ',
     'as if these things were of any consequence ! " ',
     'why did he notleave them alone ? " ',
     'who would trouble themselves about such trifles ? especially at a comedy , where every one is expected to be amused . " ',
     'thensometimes the public applauded too much , or too little , to please him . " ',
     'they are like wet wood , " he would say , looking round to see what sortof people were present , " this evening ; nothing fires them . " ',
     ' then hewould vex and fret himself because they did not laugh at the righttime , or because they laughed in the wrong places ; and so he frettedand worried himself till at last the unhappy man fretted himselfinto the grave . here rests a happy man , that is to say , a man of high birth andposition , which was very lucky for him , otherwise he would have beenscarcely worth notice . " ',
     'it is beautiful to observe how wisely natureorders these things . " ',
     'he walked about in a coat embroidered all over , and in the drawing-rooms of society looked just like one of those richpearl-embroidered bell-pulls , which are only made for show ; and behindthem always hangs a good thick cord for use . " ',
     'this man also had astout , useful substitute behind him , who did duty for him , andperformed all his dirty work . " ',
     'and there are still , even now , theseserviceable cords behind other embroidered bell-ropes . " ',
     'it is all sowisely arranged , that a man may well be in a good humor . here rests , - ah , it makes one feel mournful to think of him ! -but here rests a man who , during sixty-seven years , was neverremembered to have said a good thing ; he lived only in the hope ofhaving a good idea . " ',
     'at last he felt convinced , in his own mind , thathe really had one , and was so delighted that he positively died of joyat the thought of having at last caught an idea . " ',
     'nobody got anythingby it ; indeed , no one even heard what the good thing was . " ',
     'now i canimagine that this same idea may prevent him from resting quietly inhis grave ; for suppose that to produce a good effect , it isnecessary to bring out his new idea at breakfast , and that he can onlymake his appearance on earth at midnight , as ghosts are believedgenerally to do ; why then this good idea would not suit the hour , and the man would have to carry it down again with him into the grave\ufffethat must be a troubled grave . the woman who lies here was so remarkably stingy , that duringher life she would get up in the night and mew , that her neighborsmight think she kept a cat . " ',
     'what a miser she was ! here rests a young lady , of a good family , who would always makeher voice heard in society , and when she sang " mi manca la voce , " *it was the only true thing she ever said in her life . * " i want a voice , " or , " i have no voice . " ',
     'here lies a maiden of another description . " ',
     'she was engaged to bemarried , - but , her story is one of every-day life ; we will leave herto rest in the grave . here rests a widow , who , with music in her tongue , carried gall inher heart . " ',
     'she used to go round among the families near , and searchout their faults , upon which she preyed with all the envy and maliceof her nature . " ',
     'this is a family grave . " ',
     'the members of this family heldso firmly together in their opinions , that they would believe in noother . " ',
     'if the newspapers , or even the whole world , said of a certainsubject , " it is so-and-so ; " and a little schoolboy declared he hadlearned quite differently , they would take his assertion as the onlytrue one , because he belonged to the family . " ',
     'and it is well known thatif the yard-cock belonging to this family happened to crow atmidnight , they would declare it was morning , although the watchman andall the clocks in the town were proclaiming the hour of twelve atnight . the great poet goethe concludes his faust with the words , " maybe continued ; " so might our wanderings in the churchyard be continued . i come here often , and if any of my friends , or those who are not myfriends , are too much for me , i go out and choose a plot of groundin which to bury him or her . " ',
     'then i bury them , as it were ; therethey lie , dead and powerless , till they come back new and bettercharacters . " ',
     'their lives and their deeds , looked at after my ownfashion , i write down in my diary , as every one ought to do . " ',
     'then , if any of our friends act absurdly , no one need to be vexed aboutit . " ',
     'let them bury the offenders out of sight , and keep their goodtemper . " ',
     'they can also read the intelligencer , which is a paper writtenby the people , with their hands guided . " ',
     'when the time comes for thehistory of my life , to be bound by the grave , then they will writeupon it as my epitaph- " the man with a cheerful temper . " ',
     'and this is my story . the end . 1872fairy tales of hans christian andersena great griefby hans christian andersenthis story really consists of two parts . " ',
     'the first part might beleft out , but it gives us a few particulars , and these are usefulwe were staying in the country at a gentleman\'s seat , where ithappened that the master was absent for a few days . " ',
     'in the meantime , there arrived from the next town a lady ; she had a pug dog with her , and came , she said , to dispose of shares in her tan-yard . " ',
     'she hadher papers with her , and we advised her to put them in an envelope , and to write thereon the address of the proprietor of the estate , " general war-commissary knight , " &c . she listened to us attentively , seized the pen , paused , and beggedus to repeat the direction slowly . " ',
     'we complied , and she wrote ; butin the midst of the " general war- " she struck fast , sighed deeply , andsaid , " i am only a woman ! " ',
     ' her puggie had seated itself on theground while she wrote , and growled ; for the dog had come with her foramusement and for the sake of its health ; and then the bare floorought not to be offered to a visitor . " ',
     'his outward appearance wascharacterized by a snub nose and a very fat back . " ',
     'he doesn\'t bite , " said the lady ; " he has no teeth . " ',
     'he is like oneof the family , faithful and grumpy ; but the latter is mygrandchildren\'s fault , for they have teased him ; they play at wedding , and want to give him the part of the bridesmaid , and that\'s too muchfor him , poor old fellow . " ',
     'and she delivered her papers , and took puggie upon her arm . " ',
     'andthis is the first part of the story which might have been left out . puggie died ! ! " ',
     'that\'s the second part . it was about a week afterwards we arrived in the town , and putup at the inn . " ',
     'our windows looked into the tan-yard , which was dividedinto two parts by a partition of planks ; in one half were many skinsand hides , raw and tanned . " ',
     'here was all the apparatus necessary tocarry on a tannery , and it belonged to the widow . " ',
     'puggie had died inthe morning , and was to be buried in this part of the yard ; thegrandchildren of the widow (that is , of the tanner\'s widow , for puggiehad never been married) filled up the grave , and it was a beautifulgrave- it must have been quite pleasant to lie there . the grave was bordered with pieces of flower-pots and strewnover with sand ; quite at the top they had stuck up half a beer bottle , with the neck upwards , and that was not at all allegorical . the children danced round the grave , and the eldest of the boysamong them , a practical youngster of seven years , made the propositionthat there should be an exhibition of puggie\'s burial-place for allwho lived in the lane ; the price of admission was to be a trouserbutton , for every boy would be sure to have one , and each might alsogive one for a little girl . " ',
     'this proposal was adopted by acclamation . and all the children out of the lane- yes , even out of thelittle lane at the back- flocked to the place , and each gave a button . many were noticed to go about on that afternoon with only onesuspender ; but then they had seen puggie\'s grave , and the sight wasworth much more . but in front of the tan-yard , close to the entrance , stood alittle girl clothed in rags , very pretty to look at , with curlyhair , and eyes so blue and clear that it was a pleasure to look intothem . " ',
     'the child said not a word , nor did she cry ; but each time thelittle door was opened she gave a long , long look into the yard . " ',
     'shehad not a button- that she knew right well , and therefore she remainedstanding sorrowfully outside , till all the others had seen the graveand had gone away ; then she sat down , held her little brown handsbefore her eyes , and burst into tears ; this girl alone had not seenpuggie\'s grave . " ',
     'it was a grief as great to her as any grown person canexperience . we saw this from above ; and looked at from above , how many a griefof our own and of others can make us smile ! " ',
     'that is the story , andwhoever does not understand it may go and purchase a share in thetan-yard from the window . the end . 1872fairy tales of hans christian andersena leaf from heavenby hans christian andersenhigh up in the clear , pure air flew an angel , with a flowerplucked from the gardenof heaven . " ',
     'as he was kissing the flower a verylittle leaf fell from it and sunk downinto the soft earth in themiddle of a wood . " ',
     'it immediately took root , sprouted , andsent outshoots among the other plants . " ',
     'what a ridiculous little shoot ! " ',
     ' said one . " ',
     ' " no one will recognizeit ; not even thethistle nor the stinging-nettle . " ',
     ' " it must be a kind of garden plant , " said another ; and so theysneered and despisedthe plant as a thing from a garden . " ',
     'where are you coming ? " ',
     ' said the tall thistles whose leaves wereall armed with thorns . " ',
     'it is stupid nonsense to allow yourself toshoot out in this way ; we are not hereto support you . " ',
     'winter came , and the plant was covered with snow , but the snowglittered over it asif it had sunshine beneath as well as above . when spring came , the plant appeared in full bloom: a morebeautiful object than anyother plant in the forest . " ',
     'and now theprofessor of botany presented himself , one whocould explain hisknowledge in black and white . " ',
     'he examined and tested the plant , butitdid not belong to his system of botany , nor could he possibly find outto what classit did belong . " ',
     ' " it must be some degenerate species , " said he ; " i do not know it , andit is not mentioned in any system . " ',
     ' " not known in any system ! " ',
     ' repeated the thistles and the nettles . the large trees which grew round it saw the plant and heard theremarks , but they saidnot a word either good or bad , which is thewisest plan for those who are ignorant . there passed through the forest a poor innocent girl ; her heartwas pure , and herunderstanding increased by her faith . " ',
     'her chiefinheritance had been an old bible , which she read and valued . " ',
     'from itspages she heard the voice of god speaking to her , and telling her toremember what was said of joseph\'s brethren when persons wishedtoinjure her . " ',
     ' " they imagined evil in their hearts , but god turned itto good . " ',
     ' if wesuffer wrongfully , if we are misunderstood ordespised , we must think of him who waspure and holy , and who prayedfor those who nailed him to the cross , " father forgivethem , forthey know not what they do . " ',
     'the girl stood still before the wonderful plant , for the greenleaves exhaled a sweetand refreshing fragrance , and the flowersglittered and sparkled in the sunshine likecolored flames , and theharmony of sweet sounds lingered round them as if eachconcealedwithin itself a deep fount of melody , which thousands of years couldnotexhaust . " ',
     'with pious gratitude the girl looked upon this gloriouswork of god , and bentdown over one of the branches , that she mightexamine the flower and inhale the sweetperfume . " ',
     'then a light broke inon her mind , and her heart expanded . " ',
     'gladly would shehave plucked aflower , but she could not overcome her reluctance to break one off . sheknew it would so soon fade ; so she took only a single greenleaf , carried it home , and laid it in her bible , where it remainedever green , fresh , and unfading . " ',
     'betweenthe pages of the bible itstill lay when , a few weeks afterwards , that bible was laidunderthe young girl\'s head in her coffin . " ',
     'a holy calm rested on her face , as if theearthly remains bore the impress of the truth that she nowstood in the presence ofgod . in the forest the wonderful plant still continued to bloom till itgrew and becamealmost a tree , and all the birds of passage bowedthemselves before it . " ',
     'that plant is a foreigner , no doubt , " said the thistles and theburdocks . " ',
     ' " we cannever conduct ourselves like that in thiscountry . " ',
     ' and the black forest snailsactually spat at the flower . then came the swineherd ; he was collecting thistles and shrubsto burn them for theashes . " ',
     'he pulled up the wonderful plant , rootsand all , and placed it in his bundle . " ',
     'this will be as useful as any , " he said ; so the plant was carried away . not long after , the king of the country suffered from thedeepest melancholy . " ',
     'he wasdiligent and industrious , but employmentdid him no good . " ',
     'they read deep and learnedbooks to him , and then thelightest and most trifling that could be found , but allto no purpose . then they applied for advice to one of the wise men of the world , andhe sent them a message to say that there was one remedy whichwould relieve and curehim , and that it was a plant of heavenly originwhich grew in the forest in the king\'sown dominions . " ',
     'the messengerdescribed the flower so that is appearance could not bemistaken . then said the swineherd , " i am afraid i carried this plant awayfrom the forest inmy bundle , and it has been burnt to ashes long ago . but i did not know any better . " ',
     ' " you did not know , any better ! " ',
     'ignorance upon ignorance indeed ! " ',
     'the poor swineherd took these words to heart , for they wereaddressed to him ; he knewnot that there were others who wereequally ignorant . " ',
     'not even a leaf of the plantcould be found . " ',
     'therewas one , but it lay in the coffin of the dead ; no one knewanythingabout it . then the king , in his melancholy , wandered out to the spot inthe wood . " ',
     ' " here is wherethe plant stood , " he said ; " it is a sacredplace . " ',
     ' then he ordered that the place shouldbe surrounded with agolden railing , and a sentry stationed near it . the botanical professor wrote a long treatise about the heavenlyplant , and for thishe was loaded with gold , which improved theposition of himself and his family . and this part is really the most pleasant part of the story . " ',
     'forthe plant haddisappeared , and the king remained as melancholy and sadas ever , but the sentry saidhe had always been so . the end . 1872fairy tales of hans christian andersena rose from homer\'s graveby hans christian andersenall the songs of the east speak of the love of the nightingale forthe rose in thesilent starlight night .

     'the winged songsterserenades the fragrant flowers . not far from smyrna , where the merchant drives his loadedcamels , proudly arching theirlong necks as they journey beneath thelofty pines over holy ground , i saw a hedgeof roses . " ',
     'theturtle-dove flew among the branches of the tall trees , and as thesunbeamsfell upon her wings , they glistened as if they weremother-of-pearl . " ',
     'on the rose-bushgrew a flower , more beautiful thanthem all , and to her the nightingale sung of hiswoes ; but the roseremained silent , not even a dewdrop lay like a tear of sympathyon herleaves . " ',
     'at last she bowed her head over a heap of stones , and said , " here reststhe greatest singer in the world ; over his tomb will ispread my fragrance , and onit i will let my leaves fall when thestorm scatters them . " ',

     'among the strangers wasa minstrel from the north , the home of the clouds and the brilliantlights of the aurora borealis . " ',
     'he pluckedthe rose and placed it ina book , and carried it away into a distant part of the world , hisfatherland . " ',
     'the rose faded with grief , and lay between the leaves ofthe book , whichhe opened in his own home , saying , " here is a rosefrom the grave of homer . " ',

     'he spoke very excitedly , saying that their evil propensities would not bedestroyed , norwould the fire be extinguished , and they should never find rest . thatwas terrible to hear , and he said it in such a tone ofconviction ; he described hellto them as a miserable hole where allthe refuse of the world gathers .

     'one of theseblocks had been placed byloving hands on a child\'s grave , and one of the women whohad come outof the church walked up to it ; she stood there , her eyes resting ontheweather-beaten memorial , and a few moments afterwards herhusband joined her . " ',

     ' " the boy is wellprovided for . " ',
     'he is wherewe hope and pray to go to . " ',
     'they said nothing more , but went out towards their houses amongthe sand-hills . " ',
     'allat once , in front of one of the houses where thesea grass did not keep the sand downwith its twining roots , whatseemed to be a column of smoke rose up . " ',
     'a gust of windrushedbetween the hills , hurling the particles of sand high into the air ; another gust , and the strings of fish hung up to dry flapped andbeat violently against the wallsof the cottage ; then everything wasquiet once more , and the sun shone with renewedheat . the man and his wife went into the cottage . " ',
     'they had soon takenoff their sunday clothesand come out again , hurrying over the duneswhich stood there like great waves of sandsuddenly arrested intheir course , while the sandweeds and dune grass with itsbluishstalks spread a changing colour over them . " ',
     'a few neighbours alsocame out , andhelped each other to draw the boats higher up on thebeach . " ',
     'the wind now blew morekeenly , it was chilly and cold , and whenthey went back over the sand-hills , sand andlittle sharp stonesblew into their faces . " ',
     'the waves rose high , crested with whitefoam , and the wind cut off their crests , scattering the foam far and wide . evening came ; there was a swelling roar in the air , a wailing ormoaning like the voicesof despairing spirits , that sounded abovethe thunder of the waves . " ',
     'the fisherman\'slittle cottage was on thevery margin , and the sand rattled against the window panes ; everynow and then a violent gust of wind shook the house to its foundation . it wasdark , but about midnight the moon would rise . " ',
     'later on theair became clearer , butthe storm swept over the perturbed sea withundiminished fury ; the fisher folks hadlong since gone to bed , but insuch weather there was no chance of closing an eye . presently therewas a tapping at the window ; the door was opened , and a voice said: " there\'s a large ship stranded on the farthest reef . " ',
     'in a moment the fisher people sprung from their beds and hastilydressed themselves . the moon had risen , and it was light enough tomake the surrounding objects visibleto those who could open theireyes in the blinding clouds of sand ; the violence ofthe wind wasterrible , and it was only possible to pass among the sand-hills if onecreptforward between the gusts ; the salt spray flew up from the sealike down , and the oceanfoamed like a roaring cataract towards thebeach . " ',
     'only a practised eye could discernthe vessel out in theoffing ; she was a fine brig , and the waves now lifted her overthereef , three or four cables\' length out of the usual channel . " ',
     'she drovetowards theshore , struck on the second reef , and remained fixed . it was impossible to render assistance ; the sea rushed in upon thevessel , making aclean breach over her . " ',
     'those on shore thought theyheard cries for help from thoseon board , and could plainlydistinguish the busy but useless efforts made by thestranded sailors . now a wave came rolling onward . " ',
     'it fell with enormous force onthebowsprit , tearing it from the vessel , and the stern was lifted highabove the water . two people were seen to embrace and plunge togetherinto the sea , and the next momentone of the largest waves that rolledtowards the sand-hills threw a body on the beach . it was a woman ; the sailors said that she was quite dead , but the women thought theysawsigns of life in her , so the stranger was carried across thesand-hills to thefisherman\'s cottage . " ',
     'how beautiful and fair she was ! she must be a great lady , theysaid . they laid her upon the humble bed ; there was not a yard of linenon it , only a woollencoverlet to keep the occupant warm . life returned to her , but she was delirious , and knew nothing ofwhat had happenedor where she was ; and it was better so , foreverything she loved and valued lay buriedin the sea .

     'fragments of the wreck and pieces of wood were washed ashore ; theywere all thatremained of the vessel . " ',
     'the wind still blew violently onthe coast . for a few moments the strange lady seemed to rest ; but she awokein pain , and utteredcries of anguish and fear . " ',
     'she opened herwonderfully beautiful eyes , and spoke a fewwords , but nobodyunderstood her . - and lo ! " ',
     'as a reward for the sorrow and sufferingshehad undergone , she held in her arms a new-born babe . " ',
     'the childthat was to have restedupon a magnificent couch , draped with silkencurtains , in a luxurious home ; it wasto have been welcomed with joyto a life rich in all the good things of this world ; and now heavenhad ordained that it should be born in this humble retreat , that itshouldnot even receive a kiss from its mother , for when thefisherman\'s wife laid the childupon the mother\'s bosom , it restedon a heart that beat no more- she was dead . the child that was to have been reared amid wealth and luxurywas cast into the world , washed by the sea among the sand-hills toshare the fate and hardships of the poor . here we are reminded again of the song about " the king ofengland\'s son , " for in itmention is made of the custom prevalent atthe time , when knights and squires plunderedthose who had beensaved from shipwreck .

     'the ship had stranded some distance southofnissum bay , and the cruel , inhuman days , when , as we have just said , the inhabitantsof jutland treated the shipwrecked people so crudelywere past , long ago . " ',
     'affectionatesympathy and self-sacrifice forthe unfortunate existed then , just as it does in ourown time inmany a bright example . " ',
     'the dying mother and the unfortunate childwouldhave found kindness and help wherever they had been cast bythe winds , but nowherewould it have been more sincere than in thecottage of the poor fisherman\'s wife , whohad stood , only the daybefore , beside her child\'s grave , who would have been fiveyears oldthat day if god had spared it to her . no one knew who the dead stranger was , they could not even forma conjecture ; thefragments of wreckage gave no clue to the matter . no tidings reached spain of the fate of the daughter andson-in-law . " ',
     'they did not arriveat their destination , and violentstorms had raged during the past weeks . " ',
     'at last theverdict was given: " foundered at sea- all lost . " ',
     ' but in the fisherman\'s cottage amongthesand-hills near hunsby , there lived a little scion of the rich spanishfamily . where heaven sends food for two , a third can manage to find ameal , and in the depthof the sea there is many a dish of fish for thehungry . they called the boy jurgen . " ',
     'it must certainly be a jewish child , its skin is so dark , " thepeople said . " ',
     'it might be an italian or a spaniard , " remarked the clergyman . but to the fisherman\'s wife these nations seemed all the same , andshe consoled herselfwith the thought that the child was baptized as achristian . the boy throve ; the noble blood in his veins was warm , and hebecame strong on hishomely fare . " ',
     'he grew apace in the humble cottage , and the danish dialect spoken bythe west jutes became his language . the pomegranate seed from spain became a hardyplant on the coast ofwest jutland . " ',
     'thus may circumstances alter the course of a man\'slife ! to this home he clung with deep-rooted affection ; he was to experiencecold andhunger , and the misfortunes and hardships that surround thepoor ; but he also tastedof their joys . childhood has bright days for every one , and the memory of themshines through thewhole after-life . " ',
     'the boy had many sources ofpleasure and enjoyment ; the coast formiles and miles was full ofplaythings , for it was a mosaic of pebbles , some red ascoral oryellow as amber , and others again white and rounded like birds\' eggsandsmoothed and prepared by the sea . " ',
     'even the bleached fishes\'skeletons , the water plantsdried by the wind , and seaweed , whiteand shining long linen-like bands waving betweenthe stones- all theseseemed made to give pleasure and occupation for the boy\'sthoughts , and he had an intelligent mind ; many great talents lay dormant in him . howreadily he remembered stories and songs that he heard , and howdexterous he was withhis fingers ! " ',
     'with stones and mussel-shells hecould put together pictures and shipswith which one could decoratethe room ; and he could make wonderful things from a stick , hisfoster-mother said , although he was still so young and little . " ',
     'hehad a sweet voice , and every melody seemed to flow naturally fromhis lips . " ',
     'and in his heart were hiddenchords , which might havesounded far out into the world if he had been placed anywhereelsethan in the fisherman\'s hut by the north sea . one day another ship was wrecked on the coast , and among otherthings a chest filledwith valuable flower bulbs was washed ashore . some were put into saucepans and cooked , for they were thought to befit to eat , and others lay and shrivelled in the sand\ufffethey did notaccomplish their purpose , or unfold their magnificent colours . wouldjurgen fare better ? " ',
     'the flower bulbs had soon played their part , buthe had yearsof apprenticeship before him . " ',
     'neither he nor hisfriends noticed in what a monotonous , uniform way one day followedanother , for there was always plenty to do and see . " ',
     'theocean itselfwas a great lesson-book , and it unfolded a new leaf each day of calmorstorm- the crested wave or the smooth surface . the visits to the church were festive occasions , but among thefisherman\'s house onewas especially looked forward to ; this was , infact , the visit of the brother ofjurgen\'s foster-mother , theeel-breeder from fjaltring , near bovbjerg . " ',
     'he came twicea year in acart , painted red with blue and white tulips upon it , and full ofeels ; it was covered and locked like a box , two dun oxen drew it , and jurgen was allowedto guide them . the eel-breeder was a witty fellow , a merry guest , and brought ameasure of brandywith him . " ',
     'they all received a small glassful or acupful if there were not enoughglasses ; even jurgen had about athimbleful , that he might digest the fat eel , as theeel-breeder said ; he always told one story over and over again , and if hishearerslaughed he would immediately repeat it to them . " ',
     'jurgen while still aboy , andalso when he was older , used phrases from the eel-breeder\'sstory on various occasions , so it will be as well for us to listento it . " ',
     'it runs thus: " the eels went into the bay , and the young ones begged leave to goa little fartherout . " ',
     '\'don\'t go too far , \' said their mother ; \'the uglyeel-spearer might come and snapyou all up . \' but they went too far , and of eight daughters only three came back tothe mother , and thesewept and said , \'we only went a little way out , and theuglyeel-spearer came immediately and stabbed five of our sisters todeath . \' \'they\'llcome back again , \' said the mother eel . " ',
     '\'oh , no , \'exclaimed the daughters , \'for heskinned them , cut them in two , andfried them . \' \'oh , they\'ll come back again , \' themother eelpersisted . " ',
     '\'no , \' replied the daughters , \'for he ate them up . \' \'they\'llcomeback again , \' repeated the mother eel . " ',
     '\'but he drank brandyafter them , \' said thedaughters . " ',
     '\'ah , then they\'ll never come back , \'said the mother , and she burst outcrying , \'it\'s the brandy thatburies the eels . \' " " and therefore , " said the eel-breeder in conclusion , " it is alwaysthe proper thingto drink brandy after eating eels . " ',
     'this story was the tinsel thread , the most humorous recollectionof jurgen\'s life . he also wanted to go a little way farther out and upthe bay- that is to say , out intothe world in a ship- but hismother said , like the eel-breeder , " there are so manybad people-eel spearers ! " ',
     ' he wished to go a little way past the sand-hills , outintothe dunes , and at last he did: four happy days , the brightestof his childhood , fellto his lot , and the whole beauty andsplendour of jutland , all the happiness andsunshine of his home , wereconcentrated in these . " ',
     'he went to a festival , but it wasa burialfeast . a rich relation of the fisherman\'s family had died ; the farm wassituated far eastwardin the country and a little towards the north . jurgen\'s foster parents went there , and he also went with them fromthe dunes , over heath and moor , where the skjaerumaatakes itscourse through green meadows and contains many eels ; mother eelslive therewith their daughters , who are caught and eaten up by wickedpeople . " ',
     'but do not mensometimes act quite as cruelly towards theirown fellow-men ? " ',
     'was not the knight sirbugge murdered by wickedpeople ? " ',
     'and though he was well spoken of , did he not alsowish to killthe architect who built the castle for him , with its thick walls andtower , at the point where the skjaerumaa falls into the bay ? " ',
     'jurgenand his parents now stoodthere ; the wall and the ramparts stillremained , and red crumbling fragments layscattered around . " ',
     'here itwas that sir bugge , after the architect had left him , saidto one ofhis men , " go after him and say , \'master , the tower shakes . \' if heturns round , kill him and take away the money i paid him , but if hedoes not turn round let himgo in peace . " ',
     ' the man did as he wastold ; the architect did not turn round , but calledback " the towerdoes not shake in the least , but one day a man will come from the westina blue cloak- he will cause it to shake ! " ',
     ' and so indeed it happeneda hundred yearslater , for the north sea broke in and cast down thetower ; but predbjorn gyldenstjerne , the man who then possessed thecastle , built a new castle higher up at the end of themeadow , andthat one is standing to this day , and is called norre-vosborg . jurgen and his foster parents went past this castle . " ',
     'they had toldhim its story duringthe long winter evenings , and now he saw thestately edifice , with its double moat , and trees and bushes ; the wall , covered with ferns , rose within the moat , but the loftylime-treeswere the most beautiful of all ; they grew up to the highest windows , andthe air was full of their sweet fragrance .

     'in a north-westcorner of the garden stooda great bush full of blossom , like wintersnow amid the summer\'s green ; it was a juniperbush , the first thatjurgen had ever seen in bloom . " ',
     'he never forgot it , nor thelime-trees ; the child\'s soul treasured up these memories of beauty and fragrancetogladden the old man . from norre-vosborg , where the juniper blossomed , the journeybecame more pleasant , for they met some other people who were alsogoing to the funeral and were riding inwaggons . " ',
     'our travellers had tosit all together on a little box at the back of thewaggon , but eventhis , they thought , was better than walking . " ',
     'so they continuedtheirjourney across the rugged heath . " ',
     'the oxen which drew the waggonstopped everynow and then , where a patch of fresh grass appeared amidthe heather . " ',
     'the sun shonewith considerable heat , and it waswonderful to behold how in the far distancesomething like smokeseemed to be rising ; yet this smoke was clearer than the air ; it wastransparent , and looked like rays of light rolling and dancing afarover theheath . " ',
     'that is lokeman driving his sheep , " said some one . and this was enough to excite jurgen\'s imagination . " ',
     'he felt asif they were now aboutto enter fairyland , though everything was stillreal . " ',
     'how quiet it was ! " ',
     'the heathstretched far and wide around themlike a beautiful carpet . " ',
     'the heather was in blossom , and thejuniper-bushes and fresh oak saplings rose like bouquets from theearth . " ',
     'aninviting place for a frolic , if it had not been for thenumber of poisonous addersof which the travellers spoke ; they alsomentioned that the place had formerly beeninfested with wolves , andthat the district was still called wolfsborg for this reason . theold man who was driving the oxen told them that in the lifetime of hisfather thehorses had many a hard battle with the wild beasts thatwere now exterminated . " ',
     'onemorning , when he himself had gone out tobring in the horses , he found one of themstanding with its forefeeton a wolf it had killed , but the savage animal had tornandlacerated the brave horse\'s legs . the journey over the heath and the deep sand was only tooquickly at an end . " ',
     'they stoppedbefore the house of mourning , wherethey found plenty of guests within and without . waggon after waggonstood side by side , while the horses and oxen had been turned outtograze on the scanty pasture . " ',
     'great sand-hills like those at home bythe north searose behind the house and extended far and wide . " ',
     'how hadthey come here , so many milesinland ? " ',
     'they were as large and high asthose on the coast , and the wind had carriedthem there ; there wasalso a legend attached to them . psalms were sung , and a few of the old people shed tears ; withthis exception , theguests were cheerful enough , it seemed tojurgen , and there was plenty to eat and drink . there were eels ofthe fattest , requiring brandy to bury them , as the eel-breedersaid ; and certainly they did not forget to carry out his maxim here . jurgen went in and out the house ; and on the third day he feltas much at home as hedid in the fisherman\'s cottage among thesand-hills , where he had passed his earlydays . " ',
     'here on the heath wereriches unknown to him until now ; for flowers , blackberries , andbilberries were to be found in profusion , so large and sweet that whenthey werecrushed beneath the tread of passers-by the heather wasstained with their red juice . here was a barrow and yonder another . then columns of smoke rose into the still air ; it was a heath fire , they told him- how brightly it blazed in the dark evening ! the fourth day came , and the funeral festivities were at an end ; they were to go backfrom the land-dunes to the sand-dunes . " ',
     'ours are better , " said the old fisherman , jurgen\'s foster-father ; " these have nostrength . " ',
     'and they spoke of the way in which the sand-dunes had come inland , and it seemed veryeasy to understand . " ',
     'this is how they explained it:a dead body had been found on the coast , and the peasants buriedit in the churchyard . from that time the sand began to fly about andthe sea broke in with violence . " ',
     'a wiseman in the district advisedthem to open the grave and see if the buried man was notlying suckinghis thumb , for if so he must be a sailor , and the sea would not restuntilit had got him back . " ',
     'the grave was opened , and he really wasfound with his thumb inhis mouth . " ',
     'so they laid him upon a cart , andharnessed two oxen to it ; and the oxenran off with the sailor overheath and moor to the ocean , as if they had been stungby an adder . then the sand ceased to fly inland , but the hills that had beenpiled upstill remained . all this jurgen listened to and treasured up in his memory ofthe happiest days ofhis childhood- the days of the burial feast . how delightful it was to see fresh places and to mix withstrangers ! " ',
     'and he was togo still farther , for he was not yet fourteenyears old when he went out in a shipto see the world . " ',
     'heencountered bad weather , heavy seas , unkindness , and hard men\ufffesuchwere his experiences , for he became ship-boy . " ',
     'cold nights , bad living , and blowshad to be endured ; then he felt his noble spanish blood boilwithin him , and bitter , angry , words rose to his lips , but he gulpedthem down ; it was better , although hefelt as the eel must feel whenit is skinned , cut up , and put into the frying-pan . " ',
     'i shall get over it , " said a voice within him . he saw the spanish coast , the native land of his parents . " ',
     'heeven saw the town wherethey had lived in joy and prosperity , but heknew nothing of his home or his relations , and his relations knew justas little about him . the poor ship boy was not permitted to land , but on the last dayof their stay he managedto get ashore . " ',
     'there were several purchasesto be made , and he was sent to carry themon board . jurgen stood there in his shabby clothes which looked as if theyhad been washed inthe ditch and dried in the chimney ; he , who hadalways dwelt among the sand-hills , now saw a great city for thefirst time . " ',
     'how lofty the houses seemed , and what a numberof peoplethere were in the streets ! " ',
     'some pushing this way , some that- aperfectmaelstrom of citizens and peasants , monks and soldiers- the jinglingof bellson the trappings of asses and mules , the chiming of churchbells , calling , shouting , hammering and knocking- all going on atonce . " ',
     'every trade was located in the basementof the houses or inthe side thoroughfares ; and the sun shone with such heat , and theairwas so close , that one seemed to be in an oven full of beetles , cockchafers , bees andflies , all humming and buzzing together . jurgen scarcely knew where he was or whichway he went . " ',
     'then he sawjust in front of him the great doorway of a cathedral ; thelights weregleaming in the dark aisles , and the fragrance of incense was waftedtowardshim . " ',
     'even the poorest beggar ventured up the steps into thesanctuary . " ',
     'jurgen followedthe sailor he was with into the church , andstood in the sacred edifice . " ',
     'colouredpictures gleamed from theirgolden background , and on the altar stood the figure ofthe virginwith the child jesus , surrounded by lights and flowers ; priests infestiverobes were chanting , and choir boys in dazzling attire swungsilver censers . " ',
     'whatsplendour and magnificence he saw there ! " ',
     'itstreamed in upon his soul and overpoweredhim: the church and thefaith of his parents surrounded him , and touched a chord inhisheart that caused his eyes to overflow with tears . they went from the church to the market-place . " ',
     'here a quantityof provisions were givenhim to carry . " ',
     'the way to the harbour waslong ; and weary and overcome with variousemotions , he rested for afew moments before a splendid house , with marble pillars , statues , andbroad steps . " ',
     'here he rested his burden against the wall . " ',
     'then a porterinlivery came out , lifted up a silver-headed cane , and drove himaway- him , the grandsonof that house . " ',
     'but no one knew that , and hejust as little as any one . " ',
     'then he wenton board again , and oncemore encountered rough words and blows , much work and littlesleep-such was his experience of life . " ',
     'they say it is good to suffer inone\'s youngdays , if age brings something to make up for it . his period of service on board the ship came to an end , and thevessel lay once moreat ringkjobing in jutland . " ',
     'he came ashore , andwent home to the sand-dunes near hunsby ; but his foster-mother haddied during his absence . a hard winter followed this summer . " ',
     'snow-storms swept over landand sea , and therewas difficulty in getting from one place toanother . " ',
     'how unequally things aredistributed in this world ! " ',
     'herethere was bitter cold and snow-storms , while in spainthere wasburning sunshine and oppressive heat . " ',
     'yet , when a clear frosty daycame , andjurgen saw the swans flying in numbers from the seatowards the land , across tonorre-vosborg , it seemed to him thatpeople could breathe more freely here ; the summeralso in this part ofthe world was splendid . " ',
     'in imagination he saw the heath blossomandbecome purple with rich juicy berries , and the elder-bushes andlime-trees at norrevosborg in flower . " ',
     'he made up his mind to go thereagain . spring came , and the fishing began . " ',
     'jurgen was now an activehelper in this , for hehad grown during the last year , and was quickat work . " ',
     'he was full of life , and knewhow to swim , to tread water , and to turn over and tumble in the strong tide . " ',
     'they oftenwarnedhim to beware of the sharks , which seize the best swimmer , draw himdown , anddevour him ; but such was not to be jurgen\'s fate . at a neighbour\'s house in the dunes there was a boy namedmartin , with whom jurgenwas on very friendly terms , and they bothtook service in the same ship to norway , and also went together toholland . " ',
     'they never had a quarrel , but a person can beeasilyexcited to quarrel when he is naturally hot tempered , for he oftenshows it inmany ways ; and this is just what jurgen did one day whenthey fell out about the meresttrifle . " ',
     'they were sitting behind thecabin door , eating from a delft plate , which theyhad placed betweenthem . " ',
     'jurgen held his pocket-knife in his hand and raised ittowardsmartin , and at the same time became ashy pale , and his eyes had anugly look . martin only said , " ah ! " ',
     'ah ! " ',
     'you are one of that sort , areyou ? " ',
     'fond of using the knife ! " ',
     'the words were scarcely spoken , when jurgen\'s hand sank down . " ',
     'hedid not answer asyllable , but went on eating , and afterwards returnedto his work . " ',
     'when they wereresting again he walked up to martin andsaid: " hit me in the face ! " ',
     'i deserve it . " ',
     'but sometimes i feel as if ihad a pot in me thatboils over . " ',
     ' " there , let the thing rest , " replied martin . and after that they were almost better friends than ever ; whenafterwards they returnedto the dunes and began telling theiradventures , this was told among the rest . " ',
     'martinsaid that jurgenwas certainly passionate , but a good fellow after all . they were both young and healthy , well-grown and strong ; butjurgen was the clevererof the two . in norway the peasants go into the mountains and take the cattlethere to find pasture . on the west coast of jutland huts have beenerected among the sand-hills ; they arebuilt of pieces of wreck , andthatched with turf and heather ; there are sleeping placesround thewalls , and here the fishermen live and sleep during the earlyspring . " ',
     'everyfisherman has a female helper , or manager as she iscalled , who baits his hooks , prepares warm beer for him when hecomes ashore , and gets the dinner cooked and readyfor him by the timehe comes back to the hut tired and hungry . " ',
     'besides this themanagersbring up the fish from the boats , cut them open , prepare them , andhavegenerally a great deal to do . jurgen , his father , and several other fishermen and their managersinhabited the samehut ; martin lived in the next one . one of the girls , whose name was else , had known jurgen fromchildhood ; they were gladto see each other , and were of the sameopinion on many points , but in appearance theywere entirely opposite ; for he was dark , and she was pale , and fair , and had flaxenhair , and eyes as blue as the sea in sunshine . as they were walking together one day , jurgen held her hand veryfirmly in his , andshe said to him: " jurgen , i have something i want to say to you ; let me be yourmanager , for you are like a brother to me ; but martin , whosehousekeeper i am- he is my lover\ufffebut you need not tell this to theothers . " ',
     'it seemed to jurgen as if the loose sand was giving way underhis feet . " ',
     'he did notspeak a word , but nodded his head , and that meant " yes . " ',
     ' it was all that was necessary ; but he suddenly felt in hisheart that he hated martin , and the more he thought themore he feltconvinced that martin had stolen away from him the only being heever loved , and that this was else: he had never thought of else inthis way before , but now itall became plain to him . when the sea is rather rough , and the fishermen are coming home intheir great boats , it is wonderful to see how they cross the reefs . one of them stands upright in thebow of the boat , and the otherswatch him sitting with the oars in their hands . " ',
     'outsidethe reef itlooks as if the boat was not approaching land but going back to sea ; thenthe man who is standing up gives them the signal that the greatwave is coming whichis to float them across the reef . " ',
     'the boat islifted high into the air , so that thekeel is seen from the shore ; thenext moment nothing can be seen , mast , keel , and peopleare allhidden- it seems as though the sea had devoured them ; but in a fewmoments theyemerge like a great sea animal climbing up the waves , andthe oars move as if thecreature had legs . " ',
     'the second and third reefare passed in the same manner ; then thefishermen jump into thewater and push the boat towards the shore- every wave helpsthem-and at length they have it drawn up , beyond the reach of the breakers . a wrong order given in front of the reef- the slightesthesitation- and the boat wouldbe lost , " then it would be all over with me and martin too ! " ',
     'this thought passed through jurgen\'s mind one day while theywere out at sea , wherehis foster-father had been taken suddenlyill . " ',
     'the fever had seized him . " ',
     'they wereonly a few oars\' strokes fromthe reef , and jurgen sprang from his seat and stood upin the bow . " ',
     'father-let me come ! " ',
     ' he said , and he glanced at martin and acrossthe waves ; everyoar bent with the exertions of the rowers as thegreat wave came towards them , andhe saw his father\'s pale face , anddared not obey the evil impulse that had shot throughhis brain . " ',
     'theboat came safely across the reef to land ; but the evil thoughtremainedin his heart , and roused up every little fibre ofbitterness which he rememberedbetween himself and martin since theyhad known each other . " ',
     'but he could not weavethe fibres together , nor did he endeavour to do so . " ',
     'he felt that martin had robbedhim , andthis was enough to make him hate his former friend . " ',
     'several of thefishermensaw this , but martin did not- he remained as obliging andtalkative as ever , in facthe talked rather too much . jurgen\'s foster-father took to his bed , and it became hisdeath-bed , for he died aweek afterwards ; and now jurgen was heir tothe little house behind the sand-hills . it was small , certainly , butstill it was something , and martin had nothing of thekind . " ',
     'you will not go to sea again , jurgen , i suppose , " observed one ofthe old fishermen . " ',
     'you will always stay with us now . " ',
     'but this was not jurgen\'s intention ; he wanted to see something ofthe world . " ',
     'theeel-breeder of fjaltring had an uncle at old skjagen , who was a fisherman , but alsoa prosperous merchant with ships uponthe sea ; he was said to be a good old man , andit would not be a badthing to enter his service . " ',
     'old skjagen lies in the extreme northofjutland , as far away from the hunsby dunes as one can travel in thatcountry ; andthis is just what pleased jurgen , for he did not wantto remain till the wedding ofmartin and else , which would takeplace in a week or two . the old fisherman said it was foolish to go away , for now thatjurgen had a home elsewould very likely be inclined to take himinstead of martin . jurgen gave such a vague answer that it was not easy to make outwhat he meant- theold man brought else to him , and she said: " you have a home now ; you ought to think of that . " ',
     'and jurgen thought of many things . the sea has heavy waves , but there are heavier waves in thehuman heart . " ',
     'many thoughts , strong and weak , rushed through jurgen\'sbrain , and he said to else: " if martin had a house like mine , which of us would you ratherhave ? " ',
     ' " but martin has no house and cannot get one . " ',
     ' " suppose he had one ? " ',
     ' " well , then i would certainly take martin , for that is what myheart tells me ; butone cannot live upon love . " ',
     'jurgen turned these things over in his mind all night . " ',
     'somethingwas working withinhim , he hardly knew what it was , but it was evenstronger than his love for else ; andso he went to martin\'s , andwhat he said and did there was well considered . " ',
     'he letthe house tomartin on most liberal terms , saying that he wished to go to seaagain , because he loved it . " ',
     'and else kissed him when she heard ofit , for she loved martinbest . jurgen proposed to start early in the morning , and on theevening before his departure , when it was already getting rather late , he felt a wish to visit martin once more . he started , and among thedunes met the old fisherman , who was angry at his leavingthe place . the old man made jokes about martin , and declared there must be somemagicabout that fellow , of whom the girls were so fond . jurgen did not pay any attention to his remarks , but said good-byeto the old man andwent on towards the house where martin dwelt . " ',
     'heheard loud talking inside ; martinwas not alone , and this madejurgen waver in his determination , for he did not wishto see elseagain . " ',
     'on second thoughts , he decided that it was better not to hearanymore thanks from martin , and so he turned back . on the following morning , before the sun rose , he fastened hisknapsack on his back , took his wooden provision box in his hand , andwent away among the sand-hills towardsthe coast path . " ',
     'this way wasmore pleasant than the heavy sand road , and besides itwas shorter ; and he intended to go first to fjaltring , near bovbjerg , wheretheeel-breeder lived , to whom he had promised a visit . the sea lay before him , clear and blue , and the mussel shellsand pebbles , theplaythings of his childhood , crunched over hisfeet . " ',
     'while he thus walked on his nosesuddenly began to bleed ; it wasa trifling occurrence , but trifles sometimes are ofgreatimportance . " ',
     'a few large drops of blood fell upon one of his sleeves . he wipedthem off and stopped the bleeding , and it seemed to him as ifthis had cleared andlightened his brain . " ',
     'the sea-cale bloomed hereand there in the sand as he passed . he broke off a spray and stuckit in his hat ; he determined to be merry and light-hearted , for he wasgoing out into the wide world- " a little way out , beyond the bay , " as theyoung eels had said . " ',
     ' " beware of bad people who will catchyou , and skin you , and putyou in the frying-pan ! " ',
     ' he repeated inhis mind , and smiled , for he thought he shouldfind his way throughthe world- good courage is a strong weapon ! the sun was high in the heavens when he approached the narrowentrance to nissum bay . he looked back and saw a couple of horsemengalloping a long distance behind him , andthere were other people withthem . " ',
     'but this did not concern him . the ferry-boat was on the opposite side of the bay . " ',
     'jurgencalled to the ferry-man , and the latter came over with his boat . jurgen stepped in ; but before he had gothalf-way across , the men whomhe had seen riding so hastily , came up , hailed theferry-man , andcommanded him to return in the name of the law . " ',
     'jurgen did notunderstandthe reason of this , but he thought it would be best to turnback , and therefore hehimself took an oar and returned . " ',
     'as soon asthe boat touched the shore , the men sprangon board , and before he wasaware of it , they had bound his hands with a rope . " ',
     'this wicked deed will cost you your life , " they said . " ',
     ' " it is agood thing we havecaught you . " ',
     'he was accused of nothing less than murder . " ',
     'martin had beenfound dead , with his throatcut . " ',
     'one of the fishermen , late on theprevious evening , had met jurgen going towardsmartin\'s house ; thiswas not the first time jurgen had raised his knife againstmartin , so they felt sure that he was the murderer . " ',
     'the prison was in a townat a greatdistance , and the wind was contrary for going there by sea ; but it would not take halfan hour to get across the bay , andanother quarter of an hour would bring them tonorre-vosborg , thegreat castle with ramparts and moat . " ',
     'one of jurgen\'s captors wasafisherman , a brother of the keeper of the castle , and he said it mightbe managedthat jurgen should be placed for the present in the dungeonat vosborg , where longmartha the gipsy had been shut up till herexecution . " ',
     'they paid no attention to jurgen\'sdefence ; the few dropsof blood on his shirt-sleeve bore heavy witness against him . but hewas conscious of his innocence , and as there was no chance of clearinghimselfat present he submitted to his fate . the party landed just at the place where sir bugge\'s castle hadstood , and where jurgenhad walked with his foster-parents after theburial feast , during . " ',
     'the four happiestdays of his childhood . " ',
     'hewas led by the well-known path , over the meadow to vosborg ; oncemore the elders were in bloom and the lofty lime-trees gave forthsweet fragrance , and it seemed as if it were but yesterday that he hadlast seen the spot . " ',
     'in each ofthe two wings of the castle there was astaircase which led to a place below the entrance , from whence thereis access to a low , vaulted cellar . " ',
     'in this dungeon long marthahadbeen imprisoned , and from here she was led away to the scaffold . " ',
     'shehad eaten thehearts of five children , and had imagined that if shecould obtain two more she wouldbe able to fly and make herselfinvisible . " ',
     'in the middle of the roof of the cellarthere was alittle narrow air-hole , but no window . " ',
     'the flowering lime treescould notbreathe refreshing fragrance into that abode , whereeverything was dark and mouldy . there was only a rough bench in thecell ; but a good conscience is a soft pillow , andtherefore jurgencould sleep well . the thick oaken door was locked , and secured on the outside byan iron bar ; but thegoblin of superstition can creep through akeyhole into a baron\'s castle just as easilyas it can into afisherman\'s cottage , and why should he not creep in here , wherejurgensat thinking of long martha and her wicked deeds ? " ',
     'her last thoughts onthe nightbefore her execution had filled this place , and the magicthat tradition asserted tohave been practised here , in sirsvanwedel\'s time , came into jurgen\'s mind , and madehim shudder ; but asunbeam , a refreshing thought from without , penetrated hishearteven here- it was the remembrance of the flowering elder and the sweetsmellinglime-trees . he was not left there long . " ',
     'they took him away to the town ofringkjobing , where hewas imprisoned with equal severity . those times were not like ours . " ',
     'the common people were treatedharshly ; and it wasjust after the days when farms were converted intoknights\' estates , when coachmenand servants were often mademagistrates , and had power to sentence a poor man , fora smalloffence , to lose his property and to corporeal punishment . " ',
     'judges ofthis kindwere still to be found ; and in jutland , so far from thecapital , and from theenlightened , well-meaning , head of thegovernment , the law was still very looselyadministered sometimes- thesmallest grievance jurgen could expect was that his caseshould bedelayed . his dwelling was cold and comfortless ; and how long would he beobliged to bear allthis ? " ',
     'it seemed his fate to suffer misfortuneand sorrow innocently . " ',
     'he now had plentyof time to reflect on thedifference of fortune on earth , and to wonder why this fatehad beenallotted to him ; yet he felt sure that all would be made clear inthe nextlife , the existence that awaits us when this life is over . his faith had grown strongin the poor fisherman\'s cottage ; thelight which had never shone into his father\'smind , in all therichness and sunshine of spain , was sent to him to be his comfortinpoverty and distress , a sign of that mercy of god which never fails . the spring storms began to blow . " ',
     'the rolling and moaning of thenorth sea could beheard for miles inland when the wind was blowing , and then it sounded like the rushingof a thousand waggons over a hardroad with a mine underneath . " ',
     'jurgen heard these soundsin hisprison , and it was a relief to him . " ',
     'no music could have touched hisheart asdid these sounds of the sea- the rolling sea , the boundlesssea , on which a man canbe borne across the world before the wind , carrying his own house with him whereverhe goes , just as the snailcarries its home even into a strange country . he listened eagerly to its deep murmur and then the thought arose- " free ! " ',
     'free ! " ',
     'howhappy to be free , even barefooted and in raggedclothes ! " ',
     ' sometimes , when such thoughtscrossed his mind , the fierynature rose within him , and he beat the wall with hisclenched fists . weeks , months , a whole year had gone by , when niels the thief , called also ahorse-dealer , was arrested ; and now better times came , and it was seen that jurgenhad been wrongly accused . on the afternoon before jurgen\'s departure from home , and beforethe murder , nielsthe thief , had met martin at a beer-house in theneighbourhood of ringkjobing . " ',
     'a fewglasses were drank , not enoughto cloud the brain , but enough to loosen martin\'s tongue . he beganto boast and to say that he had obtained a house and intended tomarry , andwhen niels asked him where he was going to get the money , he slapped his pocket proudlyand said: " the money is here , where it ought to be . " ',
     'this boast cost him his life ; for when he went home niels followedhim , and cut histhroat , intending to rob the murdered man of thegold , which did not exist . all this was circumstantially explained ; but it is enough for usto know that jurgenwas set free . " ',
     'but what compensation did he get forhaving been imprisoned a whole year , and shut out from allcommunication with his fellow creatures ? " ',
     'they told him hewasfortunate in being proved innocent , and that he might go . " ',
     'theburgomaster gave himtwo dollars for travelling expenses , and manycitizens offered him provisions andbeer- there were still goodpeople ; they were not all hard and pitiless . " ',
     'but the bestthing of allwas that the merchant bronne , of skjagen , into whose service jurgenhadproposed entering the year before , was just at that time onbusiness in the town ofringkjobing . " ',
     'bronne heard the whole story ; he was kind-hearted , and understood whatjurgen must have felt andsuffered . " ',
     'therefore he made up his mind to make it up tothe poor lad , and convince him that there were still kind folks in the world . so jurgen went forth from prison as if to paradise , to findfreedom , affection , andtrust . " ',
     'he was to travel this path now , forno goblet of life is all bitterness ; nogood man would pour out such adraught for his fellow-man , and how should he do it , who is lovepersonified ? " ',
     'let everything be buried and forgotten , " said bronne , themerchant . " ',
     ' " let us draw athick line through last year: we will evenburn the almanack . " ',
     'in two days we will startfor dear , friendly , peaceful skjagen . " ',
     'people call it an out-of-the-way corner ; butit is agood warm chimney-corner , and its windows open toward every part ofthe world . " ',
     'what a journey that was: it was like taking fresh breath out ofthe cold dungeon airinto the warm sunshine . " ',
     'the heather bloomed inpride and beauty , and the shepherd-boysat on a barrow and blew hispipe , which he had carved for himself out of a sheep bone . fatamorgana , the beautiful aerial phenomenon of the wilderness , appearedwith hanginggardens and waving forests , and the wonderful cloudcalled " lokeman driving his sheep " also was seen . up towards skjagen they went , through the land of the wendels , whence the men withlong beards (the longobardi or lombards) hademigrated in the reign of king snio , whenall the children and oldpeople were to have been killed , till the noble dame gambarukproposedthat the young people should emigrate . " ',
     'jurgen knew all this , he hadsome littleknowledge ; and although he did not know the land of thelombards beyond the lofty alps , he had an idea that it must bethere , for in his boyhood he had been in the south , in spain . " ',
     'hethought of the plenteousness of the southern fruit , of the redpomegranateflowers , of the humming , buzzing , and toiling in the greatbeehive of a city he hadseen ; but home is the best place after all , and jurgen\'s home was denmark . at last they arrived at " vendilskaga , " as skjagen is called in oldnorwegian andicelandic writings .

     'at that time old skjagen , with theeastern and western town , extended for miles , with sand hills andarable land as far as the lighthouse near " grenen . " ',
     ' then , as now , the houses were strewn among the wind-raised sand-hills\ufffeawilderness in which the wind sports with the sand , and where the voiceof the sea-gulland wild swan strikes harshly on the ear . in the south-west , a mile from " grenen , " lies old skjagen ; merchant bronne dwelt here , and this was also to be jurgen\'s homefor the future . " ',
     'the dwelling-house was tarred , and all the smallout-buildings had been put together from pieces of wreck . " ',
     'there wasnofence , for indeed there was nothing to fence in except the long rowsof fishes whichwere hung upon lines , one above the other , to dry inthe wind . " ',
     'the entire coast wasstrewn with spoiled herrings , for therewere so many of these fish that a net wasscarcely thrown into the seabefore it was filled . " ',
     'they were caught by carloads , andmany of themwere either thrown back into the sea or left to lie on the beach . the old man\'s wife and daughter and his servants also came to meethim with greatrejoicing . " ',
     'there was a great squeezing of hands , andtalking and questioning . " ',
     'and thedaughter , what a sweet face andbright eyes she had ! the inside of the house was comfortable and roomy . " ',
     'fritters , that a king would havelooked upon as a dainty dish , were placed onthe table , and there was wine from theskjagen vineyard- that is , the sea ; for there the grapes come ashore ready pressedand preparedin barrels and in bottles . when the mother and daughter heard who jurgen was , and howinnocently he had suffered , they looked at him in a still morefriendly way ; and pretty clara\'s eyes had a lookof especialinterest as she listened to his story . " ',
     'jurgen found a happy home inoldskjagen . " ',
     'it did his heart good , for it had been sorely tried . " ',
     'hehad drunk the bittergoblet of love which softens or hardens theheart , according to circumstances . jurgen\'s heart was still soft- itwas young , and therefore it was a good thing thatmiss clara was goingin three weeks\' time to christiansand in norway , in her father\'sship , to visit an aunt and to stay there the whole winter . on the sunday before she went away they all went to church , to theholy communion . the church was large and handsome , and had beenbuilt centuries before by scotchmenand dutchmen ; it stood some littleway out of the town . " ',
     'it was rather ruinous certainly , and the roadto it was heavy , through deep sand , but the people gladly surmountedthesedifficulties to get to the house of god , to sing psalms and tohear the sermon . " ',
     'thesand had heaped itself up round the walls ofthe church , but the graves were kept freefrom it . it was the largest church north of the limfjorden . " ',
     'the virginmary , with a golden crownon her head and the child jesus in her arms , stood lifelike on the altar ; the holyapostles had been carved inthe choir , and on the walls there were portraits of theoldburgomasters and councillors of skjagen ; the pulpit was of carvedwork . " ',
     'the sunshone brightly into the church , and its radiance fell onthe polished brass chandelierand on the little ship that hung fromthe vaulted roof . jurgen felt overcome by a holy , childlike feeling , like that whichpossessed him , when , as a boy , he stood in the splendid spanishcathedral . " ',
     'but here the feeling was different , for he felt consciousof being one of the congregation . after the sermon followed holy communion . " ',
     'he partook of thebread and wine , and itso happened that he knelt by the side of missclara ; but his thoughts were so fixedupon heaven and the holysacrament that he did not notice his neighbour until he rosefromhis knees , and then he saw tears rolling down her cheeks . she left skjagen and went to norway two days later . " ',
     'he remainedbehind , and made himselfuseful on the farm and at the fishery . " ',
     'hewent out fishing , and in those days fishwere more plentiful andlarger than they are now . " ',
     'the shoals of the mackerel glitteredinthe dark nights , and indicated where they were swimming ; thegurnards snarled , andthe crabs gave forth pitiful yells when theywere chased , for fish are not so muteas people say . every sunday jurgen went to church ; and when his eyes rested onthe picture of thevirgin mary over the altar as he sat there , theyoften glided away to the spot wherethey had knelt side by side . autumn came , and brought rain and snow with it ; the water roseup right into the townof skjagen , the sand could not suck it allin , one had to wade through it or go byboat . " ',
     'the storms threwvessel after vessel on the fatal reefs ; there were snow-stormandsand-storms ; the sand flew up to the houses , blocking the entrances , so that peoplehad to creep up through the chimneys ; that wasnothing at all remarkable here . " ',
     'it waspleasant and cheerfulindoors , where peat fuel and fragments of wood from thewrecksblazed and crackled upon the hearth . " ',
     'merchant bronne read aloud , from an oldchronicle , about prince hamlet of denmark , who had comeover from england , landed nearbovbjerg , and fought a battle ; close byramme was his grave , only a few miles fromthe place where theeel-breeder lived ; hundreds of barrow rose there from theheath , forming as it were an enormous churchyard . " ',
     'merchant bronne hadhimself been athamlet\'s grave ; they spoke about old times , and abouttheir neighbours , the englishand the scotch , and jurgen sang the airof " the king of england\'s son , " and of hissplendid ship and itsoutfit . " ',
     'in the hour of peril when most men fear , he clasped the bride that he held so dear , and proved himself the son of a king ; of his courage and valour let us sing . " ',
     'this verse jurgen sang with so much feeling that his eyesbeamed , and they were blackand sparkling since his infancy . there was wealth , comfort , and happiness even among the domesticanimals , for theywere all well cared for , and well kept . " ',
     'thekitchen looked bright with its copper andtin utensils , and whiteplates , and from the rafters hung hams , beef , and winter storesinplenty . " ',
     'this can still be seen in many rich farms on the west coast ofjutland: plentyto eat and drink , clean , prettily decorated rooms , active minds , cheerful tempers , and hospitality can be found there , asin an arab\'s tent . jurgen had never spent such a happy time since the famous burialfeast , and yet missclara was absent , except in the thoughts andmemory of all . in april a ship was to start for norway , and jurgen was to sail init . " ',
     'he was fullof life and spirits , and looked so sturdy and wellthat dame bronne said it did hergood to see him . " ',
     'and it does one good to look at you also , old wife , " said themerchant . " ',
     ' " jurgen hasbrought fresh life into our winter evenings , andinto you too , mother . " ',
     'you look youngerthan ever this year , and seemwell and cheerful . " ',
     'but then you were once the prettiestgirl inviborg , and that is saying a great deal , for i have always found theviborggirls the prettiest of any . " ',
     'jurgen said nothing , but he thought of a certain maiden ofskjagen , whom he was soonto visit . " ',
     'the ship set sail forchristiansand in norway , and as the wind was favourableit soonarrived there . one morning merchant bronne went out to the lighthouse , whichstands a little way outof old skjagen , not far from " grenen . " ',
     ' thelight was out , and the sun was already highin the heavens , when hemounted the tower . " ',
     'the sand-banks extend a whole mile fromtheshore , beneath the water , outside these banks ; many ships could beseen that day , and with the aid of his telescope the old man thoughthe descried his own ship , thekaren bronne . " ',
     'yes ! " ',
     'certainly , thereshe was , sailing homewards with clara and jurgenon board . clara sat on deck , and saw the sand-hills gradually appearing inthe distance ; thechurch and lighthouse looked like a heron and a swanrising from the blue waters . " ',
     'ifthe wind held good they might reachhome in about an hour . " ',
     'so near they were to homeand all its joys-so near to death and all its terrors ! " ',
     'a plank in the ship gave way , andthe water rushed in ; the crew flew to the pumps , and did theirbest to stop the leak . a signal of distress was hoisted , but they werestill fully a mile from the shore . some fishing boats were in sight , but they were too far off to be of any use . " ',
     'the windblew towardsthe land , the tide was in their favour , but it was all useless ; theshipcould not be saved . jurgen threw his right arm round clara , and pressed her to him . with what a look shegazed up into his face , as with a prayer to godfor help he breasted the waves , whichrushed over the sinking ship ! she uttered a cry , but she felt safe and certain thathe would notleave her to sink . " ',
     'and in this hour of terror and danger jurgen feltasthe king\'s son did , as told in the old song: " in the hour of peril when most men fear , he clasped the bride that he held so dear . " ',
     'how glad he felt that he was a good swimmer ! " ',
     'he worked his wayonward with his feetand one arm , while he held the young girl upfirmly with the other . " ',
     'he rested on thewaves , he trod the water- infact , did everything he could think of , in order not tofatiguehimself , and to reserve strength enough to reach land . " ',
     'he heardclara sigh , and felt her shudder convulsively , and he pressed her moreclosely to him . " ',
     'now andthen a wave rolled over them , the currentlifted them ; the water , although deep , wasso clear that for amoment he imagined he saw the shoals of mackerel glittering , orleviathan himself ready to swallow them . " ',
     'now the clouds cast ashadow over the water , then again came the playing sunbeams ; flocks ofloudly screaming birds passed overhim , and the plump and lazy wildducks which allow themselves to be drifted by thewaves rose upterrified at the sight of the swimmer . " ',
     'he began to feel hisstrengthdecreasing , but he was only a few cable lengths\' distance from theshore , andhelp was coming , for a boat was approaching him . " ',
     'at thismoment he distinctly saw awhite staring figure under the water- awave lifted him up , and he came nearer to thefigure- he felt aviolent shock , and everything became dark around him . on the sand reef lay the wreck of a ship , which was covered withwater at high tide ; the white figure head rested against the anchor , the sharp iron edge of which rosejust above the surface . " ',
     'jurgen hadcome in contact with this ; the tide had driven himagainst it withgreat force . " ',
     'he sank down stunned with the blow , but the next waveliftedhim and the young girl up again . " ',
     'some fishermen , coming witha boat , seized them anddragged them into it . " ',
     'the blood streameddown over jurgen\'s face ; he seemed dead , butstill held the young girlso tightly that they were obliged to take her from him byforce . " ',
     'shewas pale and lifeless ; they laid her in the boat , and rowed as quicklyaspossible to the shore . " ',
     'they tried every means to restore clara tolife , but it wasall of no avail . " ',
     'jurgen had been swimming for somedistance with a corpse in his arms , and had exhausted his strength forone who was dead . jurgen still breathed , so the fishermen carried him to the nearesthouse upon thesand-hills , where a smith and general dealer livedwho knew something of surgery , andbound up jurgen\'s wounds in atemporary way until a surgeon could be obtained fromthe nearesttown the next day . " ',
     'the injured man\'s brain was affected , and in hisdeliriumhe uttered wild cries ; but on the third day he lay quietand weak upon his bed ; hislife seemed to hang by a thread , and thephysician said it would be better for himif this thread broke . " ',
     ' " letus pray that god may take him , " he said , " for he will neverbe thesame man again . " ',
     'but life did not depart from him- the thread would not break , but the thread of memorywas severed ; the thread of his mind hadbeen cut through , and what was still moregrievous , a body remained- aliving healthy body that wandered about like a troubledspirit . jurgen remained in merchant bronne\'s house . " ',
     ' " he was hurt whileendeavouring to saveour child , " said the old man , " and now he isour son . " ',
     ' people called jurgen insane , but that was not exactly thecorrect term . " ',
     'he was like an instrument in which thestrings are looseand will give no sound ; only occasionally they regained theirpowerfor a few minutes , and then they sounded as they used to do . " ',
     'hewould sing snatchesof songs or old melodies , pictures of the pastwould rise before him , and then disappearin the mist , as it were , butas a general rule he sat staring into vacancy , withouta thought . " ',
     'wemay conjecture that he did not suffer , but his dark eyes losttheirbrightness , and looked like clouded glass . " ',
     'poor mad jurgen , " said the people . " ',
     'and this was the end of a lifewhose infancy wasto have been surrounded with wealth and splendourhad his parents lived ! " ',
     'all his greatmental abilities had been lost , nothing but hardship , sorrow , and disappointment hadbeen his fate . " ',
     'hewas like a rare plant , torn from its native soil , and tossed uponthebeach to wither there . " ',
     'and was this one of god\'s creatures , fashioned in his ownlikeness , to have no better fate ? " ',
     'was he to beonly the plaything of fortune ? " ',
     'no ! " ',
     'theall-loving creator wouldcertainly repay him in the life to come for what he hadsuffered andlost here . " ',
     ' " the lord is good to all ; and his mercy is over all hisworks . " ',
     'the pious old wife of the merchant repeated these words fromthe psalms of david inpatience and hope , and the prayer of herheart was that jurgen might soon be calledaway to enter intoeternal life . in the churchyard where the walls were surrounded with sandclara lay buried . " ',
     'jurgendid not seem to know this ; it did not enterhis mind , which could only retain fragmentsof the past . " ',
     'everysunday he went to church with the old people , and sat theresilently , staring vacantly before him . " ',
     'one day , when the psalms werebeing sung , he sighed deeply , and his eyes became bright ; they werefixed upon a place near the altar where he hadknelt with his friendwho was dead . " ',
     'he murmured her name , and became deadly pale , andtears rolled down his cheeks . " ',
     'they led him out of church ; he toldthose standinground him that he was well , and had never been ill ; he , who had been so grievouslyafflicted , the outcast , thrown upon theworld , could not remember his sufferings . " ',
     'thelord our creator is wiseand full of loving kindness- who can doubt it ? in spain , where balmy breezes blow over the moorish cupolas andgently stir the orangeand myrtle groves , where singing and thesound of the castanets are always heard , therichest merchant in theplace , a childless old man , sat in a luxurious house , whilechildrenmarched in procession through the streets with waving flags andlighted tapers . if he had been able to press his children to hisheart , his daughter , or her child , that had , perhaps never seen thelight of day , far less the kingdom of heaven , howmuch of his wealthwould he not have given !

     ' " poor child ! " ',
     ' yes , poor child- a childstill , yet more than thirty years old , for jurgen had arrived at this agein old skjagen . the shifting sands had covered the graves in the courtyard , quite up to the churchwalls , but still , the dead must be buried amongtheir relatives and the dear ones whohad gone before them . " ',
     'merchantbronne and his wife now rested with their children underthe whitesand . it was in the spring- the season of storms . " ',
     'the sand from thedunes was whirled upin clouds ; the sea was rough , and flocks of birdsflew like clouds in the storm , screaming across the sand-hills . shipwreck followed upon shipwreck on the reefsbetween old skagenand the hunsby dunes . one evening jurgen sat in his room alone: all at once his mindseemed to become clearer , and a restless feeling came over him , suchas had often , in his younger days , drivenhim out to wander over thesand-hills or on the heath .

     ' " home , home ! " ',
     ' he cried . " ',
     'no oneheardhim . " ',
     'he went out and walked towards the dunes . " ',

     'the sand was bankedup the walls , half covering thewindows , but it had been cleared away in front of thedoor , and theentrance was free and easy to open , so jurgen went into the church . the storm raged over the town of skjagen ; there had not beensuch a terrible tempestwithin the memory of the inhabitants , nor sucha rough sea .

     'but jurgen was in the templeof god , and while thedarkness of night reigned outside , a light arose in his soulthatwas never to depart from it ; the heavy weight that pressed on hisbrain burstasunder . " ',

     'he sat down on one of the seats , and lo ! " ',
     'the candies were lighted one by one , and there wasbrightness and grandeur such as he had only seen in the spanishcathedral . the portraits of the old citizens became alive , steppeddown from the walls againstwhich they had hung for centuries , andtook seats near the church door . " ',
     'the gates flewopen , and all the deadpeople from the churchyard came in , and filled the church , whilebeautiful music sounded . " ',
     'then the melody of the psalm burst forth , like the soundof the waters , and jurgen saw that his foster parentsfrom the hunsby dunes were there , also old merchant bronne with hiswife and their daughter clara , who gave him her hand . they both wentup to the altar where they had knelt before , and the priest joinedtheirhands and united them for life . " ',
     'then music was heard again ; itwas wonderfully sweet , like a child\'s voice , full of joy andexpectation , swelling to the powerful tones ofa full organ , sometimessoft and sweet , then like the sounds of a tempest , delightfulandelevating to hear , yet strong enough to burst the stone tombs of thedead .

     'thenthe little ship that hung from the roof of the choir waslet down and looked wonderfullylarge and beautiful with its silkensails and rigging: " the ropes were of silk , the anchor of gold , and everywhere riches and pomp untold , " as the old song says . the young couple went on board , accompanied by the wholecongregation , for there wasroom and enjoyment for them all .

     ' " so they were drowned , " repeated anne lisbeth ; but she said nomore , and the subjectwas dropped . " ',
     'she felt very low-spirited , becauseher count-child had shown noinclination to speak to her who loved himso well , and who had travelled so far tosee him . " ',
     'the journey had costmoney too , and she had derived no great pleasure fromit . " ',
     'still shesaid not a word of all this ; she could not relieve her heart bytellingthe laborer\'s wife , lest the latter should think she did notenjoy her former positionat the castle . " ',
     'then the raven flew over her , screaming again as he flew . " ',
     'the black wretch ! " ',
     ' said anne lisbeth , " he will end by frighteningme today . " ',
     ' she hadbrought coffee and chicory with her , for shethought it would be a charity to the poorwoman to give them to her toboil a cup of coffee , and then she would take a cup herself . the woman prepared the coffee , and in the meantime anne lisbethseated her in a chairand fell asleep . " ',
     'then she dreamed of somethingwhich she had never dreamed before ; singularly enough she dreamed ofher own child , who had wept and hungered in thelaborer\'s hut , and hadbeen knocked about in heat and in cold , and who was now lyingin thedepths of the sea , in a spot only known by god . " ',
     'she fancied she wasstill sittingin the hut , where the woman was busy preparing thecoffee , for she could smell thecoffee-berries roasting . " ',
     'butsuddenly it seemed to her that there stood on thethreshold abeautiful young form , as beautiful as the count\'s child , andthisapparition said to her , " the world is passing away ; hold fast to me , for you aremy mother after all ; you have an angel in heaven , holdme fast ; " and the child-angelstretched out his hand and seized her . then there was a terrible crash , as of a worldcrumbling to pieces , and the angel-child was rising from the earth , and holding herbythe sleeve so tightly that she felt herself lifted from the ground ; but , on the otherhand , something heavy hung to her feet and draggedher down , and it seemed as ifhundreds of women were clinging toher , and crying , " if thou art to be saved , we mustbe saved too . hold fast , hold fast .

     ' and then they all hung on her , but there weretoomany ; and as they clung the sleeve was torn , and anne lisbeth felldown in horror , and awoke . " ',
     'indeed she was on the point of falling overin reality with the chair onwhich she sat ; but she was so startledand alarmed that she could not remember whatshe had dreamed , onlythat it was something very dreadful . they drank their coffee and had a chat together , and then annelisbeth went away towardsthe little town where she was to meet thecarrier , who was to drive her back to herown home . " ',
     'but when shecame to him she found that he would not be ready to start tilltheevening of the next day . " ',
     'then she began to think of the expense , andwhat thedistance would be to walk . " ',
     'she remembered that the route bythe sea-shore was two milesshorter than by the high road ; and asthe weather was clear , and there would bemoonlight , she determined tomake her way on foot , and to start at once , that she mightreachhome the next day . the sun had set , and the evening bells sounded through the airfrom the tower of thevillage church , but to her it was not the bells , but the cry of the frogs in the marshes . then they ceased , and allaround became still ; not a bird could be heard , they wereall at rest , even the owl had not left her hiding place ; deep silence reigned onthemargin of the wood by the sea-shore . " ',
     'as anne lisbeth walked on shecould hear her ownfootsteps in the sands ; even the waves of the seawere at rest , and all in the deepwaters had sunk into silence . there was quiet among the dead and the living in thedeep sea . " ',
     'annelisbeth walked on , thinking of nothing at all , as people say , orratherher thoughts wandered , but not away from her , for thought isnever absent from us , it only slumbers . " ',
     'many thoughts that have laindormant are roused at the proper time , and begin to stir in the mindand the heart , and seem even to come upon us from above . it iswritten , that a good deed bears a blessing for its fruit ; and it isalso written , that the wages of sin is death . " ',
     'much has been said andmuch written which we pass overor know nothing of . " ',
     'a light ariseswithin us , and then forgotten things make themselvesremembered ; andthus it was with anne lisbeth . " ',

     'anne lisbeth walked on thus withher senses half asleep , but the thoughts werefermenting within her . from one shrove tuesday to another , much may occur to weigh downthe heart ; it is thereckoning of a whole year ; much may be forgotten , sins against heaven in word andthought , sins against our neighbor , and against our own conscience .

     'we are scarcelyaware of theirexistence ; and anne lisbeth did not think of any of her errors . " ',
     'shehadcommitted no crime against the law of the land ; she was anhonorable person , in a goodposition- that she knew . she continued her walk along by the margin of the sea . " ',
     'what was itshe saw lying there ? an old hat ; a man\'s hat . " ',
     'now when might that havebeen washed overboard ? " ',
     'she drew nearer , she stopped to look at thehat ; " ha ! " ',
     'what was lying yonder ? " ',
     ' she shuddered ; yet itwas nothingsave a heap of grass and tangled seaweed flung across a long stone , butit looked like a corpse . " ',
     'only tangled grass , and yet she wasfrightened at it . " ',
     'as sheturned to walk away , much came into hermind that she had heard in her childhood: oldsuperstitions ofspectres by the sea-shore ; of the ghosts of drowned butunburiedpeople , whose corpses had been washed up on the desolate beach . " ',
     'thebody , sheknew , could do no harm to any one , but the spirit couldpursue the lonely wanderer , attach itself to him , and demand to becarried to the churchyard , that it might restin consecrated ground . " ',

     'hold fast ! " ',
     ' the spectre would cry ; and as annelisbethmurmured these words to herself , the whole of her dream was suddenlyrecalledto her memory , when the mother had clung to her , anduttered these words , when , amidthe crashing of worlds , her sleeve hadbeen torn , and she had slipped from the graspof her child , who wantedto hold her up in that terrible hour .

     'her child , her ownchild , which she had never loved , lay now buried in the sea , and might riseup , likea spectre , from the waters , and cry , " hold fast ; carry meto consecrated ground ! " ',

     'fear came upon heras if a cold , clammy hand had been laidupon her heart , so that shealmost fainted . " ',
     'as she looked across the sea , all theregrew darker ; aheavy mist came rolling onwards , and clung to bush and tree , distortingthem into fantastic shapes . " ',
     'she turned and glanced at themoon , which had risen behindher . " ',
     'it looked like a pale , raylesssurface , and a deadly weight seemed to hang uponher limbs . " ',
     ' " hold , " thought she ; and then she turned round a second time to look atthemoon . " ',
     'a white face appeared quite close to her , with a mist , hanginglike a garmentfrom its shoulders . " ',
     ' " stop ! " ',
     'carry me to consecratedearth , " sounded in her ears , instrange , hollow tones . " ',
     'the sound didnot come from frogs or ravens ; she saw no signof such creatures . " ',

     'the child that lay beneath the ocean , andwhose spiritcould have no rest until it was carried to thechurchyard , and until a grave had beendug for it in consecratedground . " ',
     'she would go there at once , and there she would dig . sheturned in the direction of the church , and the weight on her heartseemed to growlighter , and even to vanish altogether ; but when sheturned to go home by the shortestway , it returned . " ',

     'the mist was cold and damp , her hands and face were moist andclammy with horror , aheavy weight again seized her and clung toher , her mind became clear for thoughtsthat had never before beenthere . in these northern regions , a beech-wood often buds in a singlenight and appears inthe morning sunlight in its full glory ofyouthful green .

     'many things , of whichshe had feared even tospeak , came into her mind . " ',
     'silently , as the cloud-shadows inthemoonshine , a spectral apparition flitted by her ; she had heard of itbefore . " ',
     'closeby her galloped four snorting steeds , with fire flashingfrom their eyes and nostrils . they dragged a burning coach , and withinit sat the wicked lord of the manor , who hadruled there a hundredyears before . " ',
     'the legend says that every night , at twelveo\'clock , he drove into his castleyard and out again . " ',
     'he was not as pale as deadmenare , but black as a coal . " ',
     'he nodded , and pointed to annelisbeth , crying out , " holdfast ! " ',

     'and then you may rideagain in a nobleman\'s carriage , and forget yourchild . " ',
     'she gathered herself up , and hastened to the churchyard ; but blackcrosses and blackravens danced before her eyes , and she could notdistinguish one from the other . " ',

     'yes , it fledaway over thesea ; it was the ocean spectre ; and , exhausted andoverpowered , anne lisbeth sunk tothe ground , and her senses left her . it was a bright day when she came to herself , and two men wereraising her up ; butshe was not lying in the churchyard , but on thesea-shore , where she had dug a deephole in the sand , and cut her handwith a piece of broken glass , whose sharp sternwas stuck in alittle block of painted wood .

     'anne lisbeth was in a fever . consciencehad roused the memories of superstitions , and had soacted upon her mind , that shefancied she had only half a soul , andthat her child had taken the other half downinto the sea . " ',
     'never wouldshe be able to cling to the mercy of heaven till she hadrecoveredthis other half which was now held fast in the deep water . anne lisbeth returned to her home , but she was no longer the womanshe had been . " ',
     'herthoughts were like a confused , tangled skein ; onlyone thread , only one thought wasclear to her , namely that she mustcarry the spectre of the sea-shore to the churchyard , and dig agrave for him there ; that by so doing she might win back her soul . many anight she was missed from her home , and was always found on thesea-shore waiting forthe spectre . in this way a whole year passed ; and then one night she vanishedagain , and was notto be found .

     'the whole of the next day was spent ina useless search after her . towards evening , when the clerk entered the church to toll thevesper bell , he sawby the altar anne lisbeth , who had spent the wholeday there . " ',
     'her powers of body werealmost exhausted , but her eyesflashed brightly , and on her cheeks was a rosy flush . the last rays ofthe setting sun shone upon her , and gleamed over the altar upontheshining clasps of the bible , which lay open at the words of theprophet joel , " rendyour hearts and not your garments , and turn untothe lord .

     ' " that was just a chance , " people said ; but do things happen bychance ? " ',
     'in the faceof anne lisbeth , lighted up by the evening sun , could be seen peace and rest . " ',

     'he was young at that time-indeed , he is young still , although he is ten yearsolder than hewas then . " ',
     'on his return , he went to visit one of the little towns intheisland of zealand . " ',
     'the whole town knew who the stranger was ; andone of the richestmen in the place gave a party in his honor , and allwho were of any consequence , orwho possessed some property , wereinvited . " ',
     'it was quite an event , and all the townknew of it , so thatit was not necessary to announce it by beat of drum . apprentice-boys , children of the poor , and even the poor peoplethemselves , stood before the house , watching the lighted windows ; and the watchman might easily fancy he was giving a partyalso , there were so many people in the streets . " ',
     'there was quite an air offestivityabout it , and the house was full of it ; for mr . " ',
     'alfred , the sculptor , was there . " ',
     'hetalked and told anecdotes , and every onelistened to him with pleasure , not unmingledwith awe ; but none feltso much respect for him as did the elderly widow of a navalofficer . she seemed , so far as mr . " ',
     'alfred was concerned , to be like a pieceof freshblotting-paper that absorbed all he said and asked formore . " ',
     'she was very appreciative , and incredibly ignorant- a kind offemale gaspar hauser . " ',
     'i should like to see rome , " she said ; " it must be a lovelycity , or so many foreignerswould not be constantly arriving there . now , do give me a description of rome . " ',
     'howdoes the city look when youenter in at the gate ? " ',
     ' " i cannot very well describe it , " said the sculptor ; " but youenter on a large openspace , in the centre of which stands an obelisk , which is a thousand years old . " ',
     ' " an organist ! " ',
     ' exclaimed the lady , who had never heard the word\'obelisk . \' severalof the guests could scarcely forbear laughing , and the sculptor would have had somedifficulty in keeping hiscountenance , but the smile on his lips faded away ; for hecaught sightof a pair of dark-blue eyes close by the side of the inquisitive lady . theybelonged to her daughter ; and surely no one who had such adaughter could be silly . the mother was like a fountain ofquestions ; and the daughter , who listened but neverspoke , mighthave passed for the beautiful maid of the fountain .

     'how charming shewas ! she was a study for the sculptor to contemplate , but not toconverse with ; for shedid not speak , or , at least , very seldom . " ',
     'has the pope a great family ? " ',
     ' inquired the lady . the young man answered considerately , as if the question hadbeen a different one , " no ; he does not come from a great family . " ',
     ' " that is not what i asked , " persisted the widow ; " i mean , has he awife and children ? " ',
     ' " the pope is not allowed to marry , " replied the gentleman . " ',

     'alfred again spoke of italy , and of the glorious colors initalian scenery ; thepurple hills , the deep blue of the mediterranean , the azure of southern skies , whosebrightness and glory could onlybe surpassed in the north by the deep-blue eyes ofa maiden ; and hesaid this with a peculiar intonation ; but she who shouldhaveunderstood his meaning looked quite unconscious of it , which alsowas charming .

     ' echoed from every voice . " ',

     'the daughter sighed very gently ; and how much there may be in asigh , or attributedto it ! " ',
     'the young man attributed a great deal ofmeaning to this sigh . " ',
     'those deep-blueeyes , which had been lit up thisevening in honor of him , must conceal treasures , treasures of heartand mind , richer than all the glories of rome ; and so when he lefttheparty that night , he had lost it completely to the young lady . " ',

     'he came for the sake of the daughter . they calledher kaela . " ',
     'her name was really karen malena , and these two names hadbeencontracted into the one name kaela . " ',
     'she was really beautiful ; butsome said she wasrather dull , and slept late of a morning . " ',
     'she has been accustomed to that , " her mother said . " ',
     ' " she is abeauty , and they arealways easily tired . " ',
     'she does sleep ratherlate ; but that makes her eyes so clear . " ',
     'what power seemed to lie in the depths of those dark eyes ! " ',
     'theyoung man felt the truthof the proverb , " still waters run deep: " and his heart had sunk into their depths . he often talked of hisadventures , and the mamma was as simple and eager in herquestionsas on the first evening they met . " ',
     'it was a pleasure to hear alfreddescribeanything . " ',
     'he showed them colored plates of naples , andspoke of excursions to mountvesuvius , and the eruptions of firefrom it . " ',
     'the naval officer\'s widow had never heardof them before . " ',
     'good heavens ! " ',
     ' she exclaimed . " ',
     ' " so that is a burning mountain ; butis it not verydangerous to the people who live near it ? " ',
     ' " whole cities have been destroyed , " he replied ; " for instance , herculaneum andpompeii . " ',
     ' " oh , the poor people ! " ',
     'and you saw all that with your own eyes ? " ',
     ' " no ; i did not see any of the eruptions which are represented inthose pictures ; buti will show you a sketch of my own , whichrepresents an eruption i once saw . " ',
     'he placed a pencil sketch on the table ; and mamma , who had beenover-powered with theappearance of the colored plates , threw a glanceat the pale drawing and cried inastonishment , " what , did you see itthrow up white fire ? " ',
     'for a moment , alfred\'s respect for kaela\'s mamma underwent asudden shock , and lessenedconsiderably ; but , dazzled by the lightwhich surrounded kaela , he soon found it quitenatural that the oldlady should have no eye for color . " ',
     'after all , it was of verylittleconsequence ; for kaela\'s mamma had the best of all possessions ; namely , kaelaherself . alfred and kaela were betrothed , which was a very naturalresult ; and the betrothalwas announced in the newspaper of the littletown . " ',
     'mama purchased thirty copies ofthe paper , that she might cutout the paragraph and send it to friends and acquaintances . thebetrothed pair were very happy , and the mother was happy too . " ',
     'she saidit seemedlike connecting herself with thorwalsden . " ',
     'you are a true successor of thorwalsden , " she said to alfred ; andit seemed to himas if , in this instance , mamma had said a cleverthing . " ',
     'kaela was silent ; but her eyesshone , her lips smiled , everymovement was graceful , - in fact , she was beautiful ; thatcannot berepeated too often . " ',
     'alfred decided to take a bust of kaela as wellas of hermother . " ',
     'they sat to him accordingly , and saw how hemoulded and formed the soft claywith his fingers . " ',
     'i suppose it is only on our account that you perform thiscommon-place work yourself , instead of leaving it to your servant todo all that sticking together . " ',
     ' " it is really necessary that i should mould the clay myself , " hereplied . " ',
     'ah , yes , you are always so polite , " said mamma , with a smile ; andkaela silentlypressed his hand , all soiled as it was with the clay . then he unfolded to them both the beauties of nature , in all herworks ; he pointedout to them how , in the scale of creation , inanimatematter was inferior to animatenature ; the plant above the mineral , the animal above the plant , and man above themall . " ',
     'he strove toshow them how the beauty of the mind could be displayed in theoutwardform , and that it was the sculptor\'s task to seize upon that beautyofexpression , and produce it in his works . " ',
     'kaela stood silent , butnodded inapprobation of what he said , while mamma-in-law made thefollowing confession:- " it is difficult to follow you ; but i go hobbling along afteryou with my thoughts , though what you say makes my head whirl roundand round . " ',
     'still i contrive to lay holdon some of it . " ',
     'kaela\'s beauty had a firm hold on alfred ; it filled his soul , and held a mastery overhim . " ',
     'beauty beamed from kaela\'s every feature , glittered in her eyes , lurked in thecorners of her mouth , andpervaded every movement of her agile fingers . " ',
     'alfred , thesculptor , saw this . " ',
     'he spoke only to her , thought only of her , and the twobecame one ; and so it may be said she spoke much , for he was alwaystalking to her ; and he andshe were one . " ',
     'such was the betrothal , andthen came the wedding , with bride\'s-maidsand wedding presents , allduly mentioned in the wedding speech . " ',
     'mamma-in-law had setupthorwalsden\'s bust at the end of the table , attired in adressing-gown ; it was herfancy that he should be a guest . " ',

     'kaela lookedlike a doll in a doll\'s house , for everythingwas bright and new , and so fine . " ',
     'there they sat , all three ; and as for alfred , aproverbmay describe his position- he looked like a swan amongst the geese . the magicof form had enchanted him ; he had looked at the casketwithout caring to inquire whatit contained , and that omission oftenbrings the greatest unhappiness into marriedlife . " ',
     'the casket may beinjured , the gilding may fall off , and then the purchaserregretshis bargain . in a large party it is very disagreeable to find a button givingway , with no studsat hand to fall back upon ; but it is worse still ina large company to be consciousthat your wife and mother-in-law aretalking nonsense , and that you cannot depend uponyourself toproduce a little ready wit to carry off the stupidity of the wholeaffair . the young married pair often sat together hand in hand ; he wouldtalk , but she couldonly now and then let fall a word in the samemelodious voice , the same bell-like tones . it was a mental relief whensophy , one of her friends , came to pay them a visit .

     'sophywas not , pretty . " ',
     'she was , however , quite free from any physical deformity , althoughkaela used to say she was a little crooked ; but no eye , save an intimate acquaintance , would have noticed it . " ',

     'her appearance created a newatmospherein the doll\'s house , and air was really required , theyall owned that . " ',
     'they felt thewant of a change of air , andconsequently the young couple and their mother travelledto italy . " ',
     'thank heaven we are at home again within our own four walls , " said mamma-in-law anddaughter both , on their return after a year\'sabsence . " ',
     'there is no real pleasure in travelling , " said mamma ; " to tellthe truth , it\'s verywearisome ; i beg pardon for saying so . " ',
     'i was soonvery tired of it , although i hadmy children with me ; and , besides , it\'s very expensive work travelling , very expensive . and all thosegalleries one is expected to see , and the quantity of things youareobliged to run after ! " ',
     'it must be done , for very shame ; you are sure tobe askedwhen you come back if you have seen everything , and will mostlikely be told that you\'veomitted to see what was best worth seeingof all . " ',
     'i got tired at last of those endlessmadonnas ; i began tothink i was turning into a madonna myself . " ',

     'among them was abeautiful little girl , who was terribly proud ; but this had beentaught her by the servants , and not by her parents , who were fartoosensible people . her father was groom of the chambers , which is a high office atcourt , and she knewit . " ',
